<p id="thomas-text">I'm an undergraduate with a 1st class Bachelor's in Law who discovered his true passion was in IT all along. I got my first computer at 10 and proceeded to build my own in 2021. I have always been fascinated by technology and I went on to study IT at GCSE and BTEC level.</p>

<p>I achieved Distinction* at Level 3 and proceeded to attend Level 2 Cyber and Coding courses in 2023-2024 by Codenation.</p>
